an improved kawa.bat - copy to c:\kawa.bat for quick work. assumes firefox+kawa are on D: drive

~~~

Can't get it to work?

	tldr answer: proably change D: to C: in kawa.bat and check kawa and firefox
	install locations
	
	I install everything to D: but usually use the default path name otherwise,
	this explains everything
	
PS: kawa.bat is very simple atm, working on something better to replace it
